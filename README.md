# Mechanical & Electrical Engineering Curriculum
### A self created Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Curriculum with courses from MIT Opencourseware, Edx and Coursera. 

Creating a combined curriculum focusing on Mechanical and Electrical Engineering to cover the essential aspects of designing complex systems such as a rocket ship or a Formula 1 car, or even robotics based inventions akin to an Iron Man suit is an ambitious yet exciting endeavor. This curriculum blends fundamental and advanced topics from both fields, providing a comprehensive understanding necessary for such projects. Below, I've outlined a curriculum that includes courses available from MIT OpenCourseWare, Coursera, and edX, which are among the top platforms offering free and paid courses from reputable universities worldwide.

Incorporating CAD (Computer-Aided Design) courses into the curriculum adds an essential skill set for designing prototypes. CAD skills are fundamental for mechanical and electrical engineers, especially when working on complex projects like designing parts of a rocket ship, a Formula 1 car, or an Iron Man suit. I'll integrate appropriate CAD courses at strategic points in the curriculum to ensure that you develop these skills alongside your theoretical and practical engineering knowledge. The courses will be sourced from MIT OpenCourseWare, Coursera, edX, and other similar platforms to provide a comprehensive learning path.
